Did not understand everything about waste but pushed by waste on streets \ 

Started with Less Plastic campaign - then moved into managing waste holistically \ 

Our approach is to work with bulk waste generators - apartments, complexes, tech parks \

A: Feedback like ""takes us back to our childhood (pre-green revolution)"" \

A: Get customers to write blogs, experiences \

Feedback not very formal - whatsapp, email, phone call - no customer service team \","Many challenges like any growing company \

With employees there are lapses  - e.g. soft pomegranates \

Some food may not be high quality - e.g. cauliflowers as not the best season \","Customers might not know what to expect from organic - e.g. worms, rice - we have been brought up to think no insects \

Logistics is a big challenge \","Customer feedback plays a role - know them personally so get the message \

Let customers know that we will sometimes get it wrong due to perishables - cabbage with multiple layers might be rotten inside \

Stop stocking food to actively prevent issues - e.g. cauliflowers \

A: Tracking water is important - usually own sources e.g. bore wells","Usually get feedback same day \

Goal to have handicapped people as delivery - but potential security issue so idea parked for now \

Informal structure, pretty flat - perhaps not sustainable \ ",Self-funded - operations are sustainable - money pumped in to build business e.g. new warehouse will be much larger \,"Website, CRM (2 weeks old) - want many aspects but need processes in place \",Yes - office and warehouse is same location - need bigger space for volumes \,"G: Everything tracked through Excel \

English + 1 language - used to struggle now OK \

Lost mother last year so even more free time \",Weather but overrated \,"Bangalore comes across as cosmopolitan but isn't - layers do not meet - very structure caste and region wise \

Not an integrated society - every problem is because of someone else \

People don't get out of caste system even if working in IT or fashion \

How many Kannadiga friends do the north Indians have? \

Seen discrimination against Tamil maids - getting to where Mumbai is? (Shiv Sena) \

Pune citizens more civically aware \

Waste is cancer of society \

Have seen wonderful work in isolated silos - don't look or cannot look beyond those silos \

Prior experiments all over India - Gayitri only part of Motihari, not previous \

Not rooted to any specific society - need roots to work on the ground \

Want to be unifier of the various initiatives - doesn't have to be funding - not like Gates Foundation \

More aware of Pune than Bangalore due to Swacch project on mapping of resources \

Pune at tipping point of solving - easier than Bangalore due to open, communal lifestyle \",,"Food has everything to do with waste \

In my grandmom's kitchen we cooked everything - what couldn't be cooked was given to cows \

We have accepted plastic like water to sponge without thinking what would happen \

Example of milk cans in US that could be reused but weren't \

We have stopped taking bags to shopping - no more newspapers for wrapping things in shop \

Consumption is the root cause of everything \

Mom and grandmom said - these diseases were not there before \  

Longer lifespans, not living the way we did - diseases like cancer, takes us time to relate and see effects e.g. judiciously using plastic \

On air - look at Mandor - methane, dust, burning waste \

Pollution that is visible becomes invisible - incinerators are worst possible solution - don't know what happens \

Ground and surface water pollution e.g. Bellandur \

Nothing is unconnected - like cells in the tip of your finger \

Visual #1: No organ in the body is dealing with the cancer of waste - no one takes ownership \

You have to decide I need that treatment \

We see the tumour all around but not aware \

There are some activists but not a concerted effort \

Come from a problem-solving background \

Rationalisation, professionalism, communication, sense of time and deadlines \

Cannot say this is not my problem/job - stay there until the problem is solved \

Would like to be there on the ground with present initiatives \",One of our aims was to start institute that trains waste professionals - still far off \,,Yes - nothing happens otherwise - we only collaborate \,"A lot - everyday is learning \

How do different organisations work, what problems do they face? \",Not yet - firmer footprint needed first - might become part of solid waste management roundtable (SWMRT) \,"Firm No - not really transparent despite claims \

Nearly all 40 service providers in Pune project are entrepreneurs - 22-63 years - except some companies providing machinery \

No background in waste but want to live for 100 years to see the fruits of these efforts by entrepreneurs \","Yes - cannot have a centralised solution in India - solve right at the source \

Like the resources all solutions should belong to everyone \

Profit should be there but earning profit at any cost shouldn't be the aim \

Entrepreneur's perception of the problem and his own solution - solution doesn't have to be universal \",You know your problem - why expect someone from elsewhere to solve it? \,"Bureaucracies - e.g. trust registrations \

Offset tool calculated environmental cost - e.g. how much diesel in transportation \

Offset tool will be used to measure and compare solutions - showcase findings at Pune Municipality \

Would like to pilot in Bangalore with a community as well - selling points for apartments \

GCC Canada funding - tech to impact lives of waste pickers, monitoring of waste \

Mindtree - separate vertical created to solve waste - not CSR - very approachable - connected via friend's son \

Were using Mindtree tool to measure impact - 40 coding engineers - Waste Ventures India had a separate tool \

Offset tool is independent - excel sheet not app - not based on assumptions e.g. equating wet waste and numbers of trees \

Live in Marathahalli \",In Bangalore since 2007 \,"No difference between personal and professional - doesn't exist for most of us at Jaaga \

Work 24 hours: owner-operator model - pick up work calls at home, happy going to bed thinking about work \

All integrated, synced - work 12 hours a day \

Ideally should take 1 day off/week - not been possible past 4.5 years \

Get panicked when not travelling - bad sign if seen at Jaaga - means no operations \","More I have worked in the field, closer I have got to natural growth - see change from barren to green land in 5 months \

Atom by atom growth - nothing more inspirational - no human stories \","Haven't observed but sure it has - need 3rd person perspective to compare to before \

Haven't had time for self-reflection - find commonalities between life before and now - still find things I could do \","Weather - Bangalore's plantation cycle is independent of season \

Soil - Bangalore has never been a plain so no industrial/chemical agriculture - fields not contaminated \

Potential and natural quality of soil - even compared to north Karnataka - urban soil is better than outskirts (repeated agriculture) \

Delhi soil not so good - expanded fields with chemical agriculture \

Dr. Miyawaki's first forest in Bangalore had highest growth rate in the world \","Logistics, supply chain of everything - e.g. cannot get native species saplings in Bangalore due to focus on flowers \

In Hyderabad you can get 100,000 saplings delivered in 1 week \

Non-native species of plants - pollen causing health issues \

Man-power \

Trees being cut for road widening - could just widen 1 side - have seen 100+ 100 year old Banyan trees being cut - would be heritage trees in Singapore \

No time to do environmental assessment - should be 1st thing before projects like road widening \","Nothing unfortunately - we plant forests on private property - straightforward \

As social responsibility we share everything - SOP, data, costing - anyone can produce own forest using our data \","Money - non-funded, dependent on business coming in to survive \",No trees and non-native species on outer ring road - Marathahalli - HSR - Silk Board - none of the new plantations survive \,,,"Now you can see people walking around Jaaga with masks - especially from other cities \

Getting hotter - new records every year \

Visual #1: Should have drawn more cars - traffic at peak - planning to move out of Bangalore just because of traffic \

Priority is running business - cannot happen when travelling 4 hours - work from home or move to different place \

Stopped using car altogether - no space to park or drive - even public transport is not an effective solution for public mobility \

While writing Afforestt Vision document - cities so full of trees you don't go to supermarkets for fruit juice - can happen, see Istanbul and Singapore \

We are blessed with great soil and diversity of fruits but don't use it \","Person living close to forest \

When we started users were corporate CSR, now more commercial - schools, apartments, factories \

Big impact at factories - dust, uses waste water - previously one client used to vapourise waste water \","Not relevant - mostly B2B - 5 residential complexes, 3 in Bangalore \",Once in 2 months until forest is made (3 years) - reduces from there \,"Mission is to bring back native forests by creating them - all clients have helped us move closer \

Open source so anyone can use our methodology \","Business has to be standardised and follow rules - difficult in places e.g. 30 saplings available but book asks for 40 to be planted \

Logistics, unnecessary additional steps in sourcing, delays affect quality \

Watering required everyday but water scarcity in Bangalore - beyond your control \

Strong dependence on water flow rate and timing \

Attitude and culture of maintenance staff on site e.g. one person pruned a forest without asking or telling \

Manual not printed and put up anywhere but available - low visual content \

Struggle to stick to a standard - every project is different - casual problem solving \

When you deviate from standards failures happen \

If promised water is too late the forest is gone \

4 out of 64 projects have failed \","Payments are difficult - no one wants to pay \

""Barren land to forest"" is a vague statement - need 10 clients to survive for 3 years and prove \

Expectations high due to ""Japaneses"" methods - adapting to Indian soil \

In case of failures can't point to manual like in consumer products - forests grow over 3 years \

Have taken wrong projects in the past \","Written and updated standard operating procedures (SOPs) - developing culture of adhering to standards \

Frequently visit site and train people working there but expensive \

Do and show approach to training - without losing enthusiasm keep explaining until they understand \

Last step in any project is training maintenance staff - repeat until they understand - putting up manual on board doesn't work \ 

First step is to check runnng water, security - have project selection criteria \",,"Earth movers, normal IT tools, geotagging, mobile phones \

Grower bot on one project - founder is a friend \","4 full-time - Founder, Executive Director, Site Supervisor, Accounts - part-time designer - all travel except accounts \

Average age = 30.6 \

Even at full strength doesn't need more than 10 people \",Self-funded - mainly spent on salaries and small rent \,"Yes - IT runs show without infrastructure \

Want to leverage available technology for identifying species \

Want to invest in software, hardware like grower bot \","Yes - need space for meetings - office location matters \

Energy matters - have bagged 1 of biggest projects at Jaaga due to buzz of fresh businesses \

Knowing not just you are failing helps \","Sukanya on accounts and finance - banking experience \

Salim was 1st employee - handles operations - good at execution \

Sunny is Executive Director - was Deputy Director of NGO previously \

Shubhendu is Founder and works on marketing, sales and hustling \

Visuals - never implemented at clients' space - but some in manual \

Manuals are boring, no one reads them \

First eight visits are paid and mandatory \","No program for internal staff but on-site by struggling with us - not difficult, just physical skill \

If you can see big picture ""you are growing a forest"", everything falls into place \

We don't train clients per se, we train maintenance staff - in most projects clients plant the saplings under our supervision \

Adoption of manual could be difficult \

Belief, belongingness and sense of association is important e.g. Samsonite where everyone in factory came and planted \",,"Yes but difficult due to size of team - e.g. 1 successful project with Youth4Seva but couldn't keep up \

Collaborate on every project - we go as consultant and work as client's team - leave after 100 sq meters and client takes over \","Yes - growth rates increased 50% since 4 years - open to new materials, listen to local guys - changed from strict Miyawaki method \","TED Fellows Program (strongest, active) - led to open source ecology project in US with paid workshops \

Ashoka - have collaborated \","Now there is - patents not loved anymore - Miyawaki loved because he gave it away \

Won't survive in this internet age without sharing - all models are open e.g. food delivery - no choice of not sharing \",,Yes - 1 formal on open source ecology workshops in US \,"Don't play funny - philosophy has to match - priority is more forests \

Doesn't have to be formal - don't mind doing a workshop without formalisation \",No public partnerships \,"Yes - monitor income, trees planted (18600 in July 2015) \

Big organisations also solve problems - many startups do not \ ","Yes, all the time - through groups such as TED, heads at clients \

Indian culture low on afforestation - want it for free - that's why we are struggling \

Afforestation is loved and well accepted by masses but not yet a mainstream business e.g. Germany willing to pay \

Money important because we are a company - don't want grants - want to prove you can earn while solving such problems \","Yes - we are doing this e.g. Afforestt, Water ATMs \

Need entrepreneurs - can't rely on government \","What's a local entrepreneur? - I am a local entrepreneur - every entrepreneur belongs somewhere \

No advantage as an entrepreneur - your work should be so good that being local doesn't matter \

You buy local because it's better not because it's local \",No barriers - who can stop you from going online? - no one knows where big guys operate from \,"Logistics - getting the right price \

Firm from Singapore can charge 100 times more than local \

Routing through flashy international channels can help - e.g. oil packet in Kannada vs Turkish olive oil packaged in English \","Social media - celebrate so much - over-celebration of entrepreneurship \

Why does everyone want to be a leader, run a startup, be an entrepreneur? \

I would be happy being afforestation guy at Toyota - start up if that space doesn't exist \

What may seem as failure from the outside may be usual, could be categorised as experience \

Companies shut because of being unrealistic about money \

My website is hacked right now but doesn't matter because we do forestation not social media \","Media because entrepreneurs like me are weak at communicating - we should be able to communicate better \

Time to time have engaged designer but needs money \

Need budgets to hire IT and reclaim website - priority is new forests in new places - other problems can wait \

Need very talented team - problem when everyone wants to be a leader \

Every leader needs 10 followers - how do you hire if every graphic designer wants their own company \

New fad of leaving high-paying IT jobs and planting trees - need right skills to apply to new fields \

Do things together not separately \

Don't consider myself a businessman and don't know about startup - what is a startup? \","Vivek Geelani from Carbon Balance, Mumbai Votes \","Are you benchmarking against any other programs? \

You get involved personally in the operations so that's great \

Impact Hub, Vilgro already but their execution is not great \

Went to Ashoka for space but they don't have space \

Visual #2: Lots of government interaction but no projects \

Visual #2: Media has become problematic - expectations high for 4 person company - especially after TED talk \

Visual #2: Research in 2011 with forestry students, 2013 with university \

Visual #2: Incubator - Deshpande Foundation in Hubli \

Visual #2: Most individual mentors are not good, even from TED - forced mentors are a disaster \

You can find a mentor on Youtube if you really need one - things are changing too fast \

No one can teach you business - they can teach you math \

Program should focus on media - without media Afforestt would have done nothing - still get leads from YourStory article in 2014 \

Mentorship, incubation are outdated models - waste time, not helpful \

Startups should run after journalists - more important than all other support ecosystem together \"

Not one particular person, it's a process \","At different levels - social, of course: you realise how much you have, no cribbing - there are people without anything \

How to integrate waste-pickers into formal \

Dry waste collection centre are under Hasiru Dala's name, waste pickers manage - tried different models - coop, partnership - entrepreneurship is best way to go \

5000 waste pickers issues ID cards with BBMP logo and commissioner's signature - BBMP maintains database - Hasiru Dala sat with BBMP to create basic software \

Pune/Mumbai (vs Blr): vibrancy in the poor - early 90s we started wastepickers work there - Dalit movement very strong in Maharashtra - grassroots Ambedkar followers level of awareness \

Pune/Mumbai (vs Blr): organisation of waste pickers didn't happen in Blr - govt saying no waste pickers here in Blr \

Waste pickers called ""chappar"" = Blr local derogatory term, refers to bag on shoulder with shoes, reference to those who steal - waste pickers would call themselves that - Hasiru Dala stopped practice \

Waste pickers are doing work of the city - 150 tonnes of waste saved from landfill - BBMP saves 80+ crore/year \

Hasiru Dala + Jain College + Waste Wise have certification course on how to professionalise work \

Hasiru Dala is 3rd party providing management services - waste pickers pay for management - BBMP x Scrapdealers = movement \

BBMP wants to give centres to contractors - SWMRT PIL against this \

In Pune, door to door collection done by waste pickers - when coming here found in Bangalore would be tough to fight - bulk generators (50+ apartments, 10+ kilo waste) = huge opportunity \

Akshay - 32y old - kept coming to Hasiru Dala - pushed me to think how can I raise money to hire 1 person \

Franchises of waste pickers - Hasiru Dala does marketing and monitoring - citizens ready to give (segregation) \

Contractors were threatening - at the time 3000 Hasiru Dala staff decided to fight, went to court against contractors \

Residential sector needed lot of support - HD services 64 apartments, 12000 households - if waste is not segregated we do not touch \

HD has 5 biogas units - waste pickers manage - doesn't require you to walk a lot \

Science is easy, technology is difficult - staff knows everything, 34 people \

Private - skill mapping of village farmers - 10-15 years ago, then children (pre-teens) now 33-38 yrs old, urban gardeners - experiential training, storytellers - community gardening requests in villas \

We start with handholding, then become management support - operations need to be scaled up - waste pickers are entrepreneurial by nature \

Scrap dealers, more men - Waste pickers, more women \

Last year (2014) we created 540+ jobs - Tough to create new jobs

Biogas units - BBMP brings in waste \

Donate dry waste - 1 tonne of waste per week \

Azeema just joining Hasiru Dala - spoke about cooking recipes on Radio Active - now learning about waste management \",,"A: Can see a difference in water in RR slum, now yellow/red, previously white - corporation water - 10 people together buy water from tanker 2/3 times/week - people who go to work buy Bisleri - Local councillor fixing pipes to prevent contamination \

208 apartments in locality now from slum board - slum leaders have taken over some apartments \
",,,,,,,,"There are 72 categories of waste - people should know \

Lots of scrap dealers in city (25/ward) - you need a small plot to be a dealer \

Weight is less but volume looks large e.g. thermocol - costs Rs. 5/kg, sells for Rs. 9/kg but most spent on transporting - 50kg/truck, rent Rs. 500 \

If you separate from rubbish it's easier - e.g. use yoghurt from cans fully then easier to recycle \

Payment every Saturday to all 10 employees, Rs. 50-100 daily for expenses \

RR slum: some work at wedding halls, some sell veggies, some in DWCC - all kinds of people - some have gone back to their native towns - not all houses equal - people don't see everyone as equal - community chain is breaking \","Have been thinking for a while would be easier if people donate dry waste - Satyam from Mindtree developed Donate Dry Waste - phone numbers of all residents - mobile phones with all pickers, tablet with Mansoor updated automatically - used internet to promote \

Field work necessary to understand issues \
",,,,,,,,,Received business training - communication - certificates \,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coverage in media helps - helps people understand \

We get help from many people - want to help too \

Technology is making things easier - if Reliance didn't bring in phones for Rs. 301/501 no one would have them - other big co should do the same - 5-6 years ago no phones in community, now everyone has one and lends without hesitation - I have a Rs. 6500 phone \

I didn't know internet - now download movies - kids know all games, teach Mansoor - Azeema is shocked \","Azeema dream: never went to school, want our kids to go study well, experience - didn't have a dream, now can \","Lots of challenges - used to it now - when can't solve, reach out to Hasiru Dala - want to train others, give suggestions \

Everyone has challenges, approach to solution matters - reach out to others if needed - e.g. if I don't have workers I reach out to Amjad \

Scared of contractors \",,"We want to help - money, work - Sometimes raise funds within group if needed by someone - money belongs to everyone - sometimes write off loans if losses in business but need to understand \

Consider DWCC - what are issues - why is it not working fine - find out and help if guys running are good, otherwise replace - if you give to Sahukar they won't do anything themselves, so give to workers directly \

BBMP wants to contract out - who will eventually do it? e.g. you won't be able to do it like Mansoor, you will go find someone like Mansoor - just give it to Mansoor, understand issues and help us run business - we have 20-25 years experience in this \

We use everything provided by Hasiru Dala - electric vehicle was assembled here with parts from Delhi - took it around to raise awareness  \

Made unofficial ID card for himself and 4 others to avoid carrying BBMP letter everywhere - letter doesn't have photo, can revoke anytime, employee status but no salary - ID has photo, causes fewer problems \

BBMP selected 20/40 applicants for ID card - not just Hasiru Dala, Namana and Saahas too - proud that more from Hasiru Dala \

2.5 years ago no one knew there was DWCC here - first 3 months we were just sitting and waiting since no one knew - Hasiru Dala gave salaries for 2 months - raised awareness by printing visiting cards with phone number, home and work address - card now with 1000+ people \",,"2nd visiting card in 2014-15 - now want our logo (first card has stylised ""MA"") - really like 1st card as lots of thought went into it - now tech helps: Google, Facebook \

Women: lots of change due to Hasiru Dala - ride a 2 wheeler - used to live horribly (bathe once a week), now live clean, bathe everyday, change clothes, areas look better (cleaner) - now no one says you are married, have 3 kids, people encourage to do your own thing \

Electric vehicle was here for training for 1 month - 1.2L, cost prohibitive \

Voluntary work in every ward will transform city \

Azeema: Mansoor too busy to teach me how to use internet - health OK, go for checkups if ill \

3 kids (5th:B, 4th:B, 2nd:G) go to Oxford sponsored private school - subsidised fees and books - Rs. 15000 for all 3 all inclusive (books, clothes, fees) - boys went to govt school until 2nd, 3rd (Mansoor went there too) - give time if people can't pay - sometimes let fees go - travel by auto/van \ 

Took over centre from Sunder who was not running it properly - went from 2 to 10 people - had some issues initially (travel) - took loan of Rs. 20000 at 0% interest from Maitree Sarva Seva (Hasiru Dala connected) \"

Background in clinical psychology - studied developmental psychology - professionally couldn't get involved - employee #1 at Civic hosted by Max Mueller in formative years - looking at what was happening to Bangalore as a city - people were divorced from planning+management of city \

Got into urban governance, participatory democracy - accidental involvement through national conference, helped organise logistics for 2 months while between jobs in 1992 - found principles very interesting - chucked clinical psychology which was long term aspiration \","In a big way - try to practise what we preach and teach - environmental conservation (waste management, water use, power conservation) - standing up for rights - complaining about local civic issues \",,"Difficult to isolate socio and environmental - lot to do with governance and democratic citizenship (citizens: how responsible, how active in politics, how apathetic, to what extent they stand up for socio-enviro challenges) \

Governance (planning, policy) + people (residents, users of public service) -> breakdown of civil order \

Environmental challenges stem from infrastructural challenges - e.g. poor public transport leads to personal transport, causes air pollution - per-capita vehicular use highest in Bangalore \","CMCA not directly addressing these challenges - indirectly by promoting civic awareness \

Tried engaging with adults for 8 years, mostly senior citizens (pensioners) talking middle class issues - disillusioned trying to get adults involved (lack of mass support at protests, public meetings) \

Nurturing civil society at young age so that in 20-30 years civil society would be stronger \

In lower classes you see participation across age groups - environment gets labelled a middle-class concern \

Government school programs - education entitlements, basic rights - train children to carry out audits - open their minds, look at immediate environment (school): sewage, garbage, public urinals below human dignity - try to inspire: awareness, sense of value, motivate toward action \ ",,"Class-oriented pockers - Whitefield Rising, many organisations in Koramangala - very concerned with their specific areas without cohesion to lower-income pockets in same neighbourhood \

Not aware of any organisation in marginalised communities - Rajendra Nagar slum has organised communities - Awaaz - wherever committed NGOs are there is activism alive \

Activism is a survival tool, not leisure - access to basic services \","No research separate from annual impact assessment built into program - document acts of active citizens (1000+) \

Every school has teacher coordinator - teacher meets, principal meets - in most government schools teachers don't attend civic club meets \

Not much research into identifying resources - respond to requests based on whether equipped to \",,,"Youth, 14-30 years old \

Youth clubs - pilot in Tumkur - 20-35 year old, all male \","Most youth don't work in salaried professions - rural: 5-6k - urban: 10k/month \

Invited applications from clubs using newspapers - almost all boys' clubs, mostly recreational - some self-help groups with limited mandate (microfinance, savings) - broaden their mandate, make them effective civil society clubs - shocked to see no women/girls \

Interact as observer - sometimes invited to give a talk \",Structured feedback from all participants - used during annual evaluations - try to incorporate through workshops \,"Civic tutor is the deliverer - no prior teaching/facilitation experience - sometimes performance not up to mark even after 1 year \

Volunteer driven program \

Lots of baggage, prejudices, value systems \

Internal team's talent to manage - affordability, searching \

HR - advertise on job sites - 50% match, yield and evolve to needs - 50% need a lot of handholding \",Can't scale core program - can't be diluted \,"Rigorous training for civic tutors - induction - curriculum/soft skills training - 3 days initial + periodical in 1st half of academic year - training up to 2 years \

Every civic tutor is graded based on impact assessment - lowest grade civic tutors asked to leave \

HR - on the job training - long learning rope \

Some alumni have come back as volunteers \","Expansion is through partnerships - schools evince interest - some offer CMCA as part of menu of voluntary programs \

In government schools, all 8th grade students have CMCA civic club as mandatory \

Curriculum/intervention fits with academic year - open beyond this but no structured environment \","Mostly human resources - mostly volunteer driven (300, 4-5 hours/week), students to pensioners (typ. 30-35 year old homemaker, have time to volunteer) \

Profile of volunteers has changed in Bangalore - more time previously, would take additional tasks, transport situation has worsened - still able to induct and sustain - retention 60% over 2-3 years \ ","Paid team is 45, 18 in present office - 100+ volunteers - Bangalore - >50% team is women \","Honorarium for volunteers to cover travel and out of pocket expenses - Rs. 150/day, Rs. 700/month \

50% program based funding + 50% institutional funding - no domain funding \","Just begun to explore technology - volunteer reporting is critical but they don't want to report as it's regimented leading to dropouts \

Last year came out with mobile app ""InstaReport"" built by 3 students from BITS Pilani - piloted in Bangalore last year - expanding to other cities - would like Kannada, Tamil and Hindi versions \","No design behind office - was joint initiative of Public Affairs Centre (PAC) and Civic Society - PAC relocated to Bommasandra, CMCA stayed in city following struggle - team used to Koramangala, in present office since 2006  \","People with: comms, visual design, project management, finance, academic know-how on civic society, research + statistics (consultant) - domain specific knowledge of youth \","Yes and no - some skills are difficult to transfer across organisation - others e.g. ""research methodologies"" shared via workshops - 0.5 day workshop on data and statistics - report writing workshop every year - social media \","Actively promote internal collaboration - domains (e.g. backend, curriculum, capacity development) collaborate as basis of all programs \","Collaboration is modus operandi - see list of partners \

Planning national workshop on civic society (Edu World, Amnesty, CMCA) \",,"Have tried to participate - don't see any formal platform - none in Bangalore \

When there are issues, participate in protests/campaigns - e.g. Alternative Law Forum on Mysore pub incident - Dengue epidemic threat \","Yes and no - sharing more of a trend due to digital - reluctance/resistance to share - competition, so called ""traded secrets \

Solutions: create a portal - reduce unhealthy competition, promote trust - more expensive: periodic congregation \",,"200 partnerships - MoU with every school - not with government schools, permission from ministry of education \","School should give 1 weekly session within regular timetable across entire academic year \

Designate teacher-coordinator \

Undertake to send children on field trips \

Audio-visual equipment within school \

Partners who run program on behalf of CMCA have to: sign MoU with CMCA - recruit+train volunteers - identify schools - manage finances \","20% public programs - only government supported program is with Mysore City Corporation (permissions, funds), questions+create hurdles but good to portray as partners \","Built into program design \

Longitudinal study - gong back to 5 year old alumni and understand level of retention - pilot in Bangalore following selected group of individuals - can 20 sessions make a dent - short term or deep rooted? \

If no longer term effect - consistent interventions need continuing into college and beyond \",,,"Entrepreneurship is a behavioural attribute - grow up like that, exposure, inputs, experience \","Startups are pilots - trials - limited funding - testing the waters \

BITS Pilani app team is a startup - not entrepreneurs yet \

Startups vs enterprise - scale \",,Key role is to offer an innovative solution to an existing challenge/problem - success depends on innovation - need for such service exists \,"Depends on sphere of entrepreneurship - in waste management Bangalore is a pioneer in testing innovative solutions, segregation since 89-90 \

Lots of individuals and organisations with knowledge \

Premier environmental institutes \

Great base of resource institutes and education - skill building, vocational \","No barriers to entry - difficult terrain - need to have good business plan \

Need to keep ears and eyes on ground for sources of data \","Scaling issues \

New entrepreneurs: financial resource - limited understanding of sector/domain \

CMCA Incubation: We incubated a female entrepreneur looking at positive reinforcement of good traffic behaviour detected by traffic cameras - coordination with traffic management centre and RTO who wanted this practice institutionalised \

CMCA incubation: Provided space, managed finances - after 1 year realised not CMCA's cup of tea - handed over initiative to entrepreneur - she may partner/set up own org - asked volunteers if they would join \",,"Mentorship - headstrong entrepreneurs have an idea, passion makes them a bit arrogant - need to be open - should balance social and commercial - often start as social, drift towards profit - might lose cause vs commerce \",,"Map #4: Lot of linkages between resources and challenges - presume poor are worst affected - some challenges can be alleviated by purchasing power \

Map #4: Primary occupation of people changes as city grows - specifically agriculture \

Map #4: Need to have a holistic perspective that is biased toward disadvantaged - can't treat anything in isolation - interventions have to be holistic - don't know how many entrepreneurs would have this perspective \

Thought of age range to entrepreneurs: 30-40 (for successful) - alluded to difference to startups \

Map #1: Visual depicts divided city  Bangalore as a city is highly fragmented - urban design - see discrimination spatially like most cities in 3rd world countries - highly uneven space socially - full of black spots \

Map #1: Poorer parts of Bangalore are also environmentally deprived - trees, parks missing - not like European cities where you don't see huge difference - in Blr growth has led to disparity in socio, enviro and economy \

Map #1: Garbage management sucks - still a distinction - poorer areas much more neglected to e.g. Koramangala - red spots are filth and black spots \

People and their backgrounds are driving the socio-environment they enjoy \

Map #2: 10 domains at head office - one team dedicated to pilots \

Map #2: Moved from logical framework analysis to results based management \

Map #2: Wanted diverse board of trustees - executive committee is driven by trustees \

Map #2: Run events like ""Traffic Police Day"", ""Municipal Sweepers' Fortnight"" - motivate civic society members to thank, visit ward offices and give self-made cards - leads to sweepers opening up and sharing their stories \"

Heads Industrial Energy group - 30 reports/year in India \

Wife is a lecturer - 2 kids - plan accordingly - TERI is accommodating \","Work looks difficult - client expectations drive us \

30% of assignments is repetition from previous projects - ISO system (feedback on methods, processes) - high success rate \

Library is used regularly - he visits weekly - open to public but some reports  are confidential - spends 0.5 hour/day on new books - also have an online library \","TERI building built 2000 has passive architecture - foul smell from drain does not enter building (Cudappah stones) \

Once you are interested it is easy - used example of library research on pumps for younger on-site colleague - training of younger colleagues important to retain - small inputs to improve their output \

Not as easy as normal job - client-facing - understand, research, debate with experienced professional - build confidence with client: once they are convinced they will invest \",,"Map #1: Traffic - colleagues + neighbours using carpooling - large PSUs like HAL, BEL allocate housing to 20% staff - no traffic issues in residential colonies - no late arrivals - importance of residential complex close to company \

Investors coming in should come with long term plan - law/enforcement for employee housing near workspaces - avoid traffic, resultant smoke, pollution - 200,000 jobs forecast over next 3-4 years \

Water is biggest challenge - 40% water from Cauvery goes back after treatment - why should water leave the city once it has entered? - need multiple levels of treatment - other uses beyond gardening, filling ponds - TERI consulted for BEL on rainwater harvesting pond \

Solid waste management - waste to energy in Pune, Solapur without segregation - methods without segregration too but issue with biomedical waste \

Medical waste separation successful in Blr with German co - hospitals, clinics register and pay for waste removal - can save 600Cr for BBMP and contribute to street lighting - unit generation cost Rs. 8-10, comparable to renewable \

Waste issue: domestic sector - offices have some system around collection - does waste get to dumpyard - value in manure \","Social transmission work with municipalities and governments and take directly to stakeholders - e.g. solar: lighting a billion lamps - cookstoves taken to people by marketing team \

Everyone has targets, clients - all areas have outreach aspect & publish in a magazine \

Identify problems and then do research - bringing it to grassroots - e.g. benzene exposure of petrol station assistants - found solution to reduce emissions, now funded by oil cos - identified problem through basic research \

Corporate research: popular to look at scalable, specific problems - especially in coal belt - some problems driven by environmental notices \

Researchers select partners based on requirement of each project - freedom granted by TERI - TERI's core changes over time \

Gender mix: ~50% - lots of women researchers - economics, basic sciences \

Delhi team (directors) participate with policy makers - 15% time on proposals - researchers spend 30-40%

TERI Delhi has incubators - biotech and renewable - 4-5 years \

Every individual can generate ideas, present to group - literature survey, consult with distinguished fellows (from core sectors) for know-how, guidance - prepare proposal for internal or external funding \",,Peenya has large water issues - very little groundwater - recommended tie-up with Yelahanka water treatment \,,,,"Support regulatory authorities, UN \

Do not market - if a client is really interested they should approach \

Industries, private sector, government, agencies (municipalities, UN) \

Some patented products used on projects (not for public) - some patents on bioplastics (joint R&D with central govt) \

India's Gruha rating developed by TERI & provided to new constructions - simulations, material selection \

Do applied research: scientific consulting since market is known - and basic research: e.g. materials \

No direct door-door research \",,,,Communication gaps \,,"ISO certification - rigorous reviews - systems \

Projects have planners - peer reviewers (nominated by project lead): depending on project value and timespan - e.g. 1L of 1Cr budget for reviewer \

Project monitoring cell (scheduling, ERP, linked to appraisal, client payments) - reevaluate implementation based on client feedback \

Minimum of 2 people/project - max 6 projects/person - team members have to have relevant skills \","1-2 publications/year - linked to appraisal \

Each person has to work 9-10 person months on projects - 10-15% skills development - 5% outreach - 1 person month leave \","Knowledge - manpower - IP - scientific instruments: spend a lot (1Cr) on calibration annually to meet ISO requirement \

Everyone has their own entrepreneurial drive, work on wide range of projects - groups ideate on problems and solutions - lead to product development \

Lots of TERI folk go onto PhD programs abroad \",,,Latest software tools - used statistical analysis - buy these tools mainly from European market \,"All TERI facilities have passive architecture with local features - employee health benefits from not having forced ventilation - initial cost for such buildings is about 50% higher but pays off \

Delhi office has underground air circulation system - Assam office built with local bamboo - Bangalore office uses Cuddapah stones from 200km away \","Team of 15: civil, computer science, electrical, electronics, mechanical \

Average age: 30-32 - 5 employees > 20 years, 5 > 10 years - passion for energy sector - haven't lost people \

TERI university grads preferred - toppers of Masters come for internship - courses are unique - only Masters and Doctoral - MSc (sust. dev) have been employed by other sectors e.g. cement (want to replace coal with biomass) \

Analytical skills - why has client called, how - is it worth considering renewable energy - which system is most appropriate \

TERI ","3-4 years training - exposure to various industries - clients want experienced people \

Skills exchange: how is the junior employee interacting - experienced employee supervises and mentors \

Opportunities in India for TERI in energy efficiency give exposure and knowledge: can export to other countries for capacity building \",,"Marketing team collaborates and licenses IP \

Collaborate with central research institutes (CPRI etc) - based on joint projects \

Social transmission group works with various community platforms - Light up a Billion Lamps (LABL) targets youth from rural areas \

Member of Energy committee of Bangalore Chamber of Commerce and Industries - 8-9 members - call for inputs - take inputs from industry, regulatory bodies to influence policy - sometimes send colleagues - meet once/3 months - workshop on energy efficiency \",,,"Now - Bureau of Energy Efficiency shares online - maintain confidentiality of specifics - if you are looking at specifics, you will be able to get data \",,"GIZ: German Technical Cooperation - 1995-1999 \

40 people in Bangalore - rural, building groups have good partnerships in public and private \

More beneficial program partnerships with public - private partnerships through projects \",,,Project monitoring scheme - standardised throughout TERI - can be customised per value and timespan of project \,"Do good business to help industries and people \

Favourite project: solar in govt schools - net metering, spend 70-80% on energy billing - should get money back -  monitor and see real benefits - work with school teachers, parents and students - capacity building, promote appliances, behavioural changes - target 1L students (6-10 std) \",,,,,,"Good market (cost of power, new tech) - can carry an entrepreneur \

Basic research important (end users will be different) - hard work, patience, not quick - travel to rural - uncertainty of market - network, reach to people \","Experience - can solve by networking, pulling in good people - good entrepreneurs find a way \

No barriers in finance \","Indian entrepreneurs not geared up for international markets - confusion around payments, delivery - systems & processes not up to mark for export - unskilled manpower - e.g. compared to China, issues with delivery: SOPs, quality of product - go with quality or market (low quality) \

New entrepreneurs should assess before entering - approach TERI (social transmission group) - enquire about govt schemes - some doing good (not high profits) e.g. biogas for farmers - importance of AMC to maintain life \",,"Understand and leverage: govt programs (some products suitable) e.g. digging up lakes (desilting), entrepreneurs could do more in terms of beautification - young politicians open to entrepreneurs \",,"Cook stove: R&D by biomass team within Energy including design and patenting - work with entrepreneurs for prototyping - royalties \

Know only 1 person who left to start up - NGO in IIT Bombay network - few others have started consultancies, usually after 4-5 years at TERI \

Map #4: No power issues in Bangalore urban (sufficient supply, UPS, zonal protection) \

Map #4: Water: reuse - has energy impact - quality - purifiers need energy too - pumping to apartments - end user energy consumption due to water (pumping, heating etc) is up to 60% \

Map #4: Transport: health issues - travels by car - eager to use metro \

Map #4: Solid waste management - health issues - need for effective planning \

Need study on how much are people spending on health compared to 1990s - could be done by IISc, NIMHANS \

Trucks that collect waste get damaged leading to leaking - need high grade steel like power plants \

TERI Delhi working on technologies for waste to manure - also working with regulatory  commission on tariff structure attractive to municipal solid waste to energy \

Map #2: Social Transformation group works closes to ground - takes other groups' R&D to masses through NGOs, panchayats etc \

Biotech group works closely with Koromandel fertilizers to reduce soil pollution - white powder blows into Vizag \

Map #2: Separate outreach group - TERI quiz - TERI Prakruti School - TERI University - Narasimha Rao sometimes shares expertise via video conference - Delhi staff more involved \

Map #2: External: Project based - e.g. Education group working with BESCOM to reduce energy consumption in schools with solar PV - excess power sold to grid \

Difficult to measure impact - Takes years - Not unique to IIHS - Govt officials move so much that difficult to say how they are using learning \","Rigorous, internal peer review system - external peers too (extensive advisors) - collegial, not separate team - Donors review too before publications \

Constant process to learn and improve data collection & dissemination \","Follow up conversation - Staying in touch with alumni - Hard to say whats working \

Concept of organic farming (1988) via seminars, workshops - Started following, esp with acad background - Taught in college, topics related to farming(horticulture) \

Bought 100 acres wasteland in TN - every agri resource was very poor (soil, windy, saline groundwater) - Rain shadow, 1300ft above sea level - Closeby Kollachi, largest coconut, coir industry - Coir-> Fibre (dust as waste) - waste land + industrial waste: improve the soil \ ","Very passionate - Was comfortable with teaching job and plantations - Comfortable background - Tremendous social capital - Need challenge, don't like comfort - More challenges= more excitement \

Pvt ltd co 16 years ago - Concept of organic farming was not a broad acceptable norm in India - Now it has changed - Started waste management 20 years ago - Now everyone talking about it \

Waste affects quality of life - Knowingly and unknowingly we have been generating solutions; now we have opportunities - Each waste is a different challenge and needs evaluations \","As an outsider - Lot of people  have traveled/lived abroad, exposed to better situation, not happy with disorder here - Realization that it could be better is important - Proactive people creating awareness, solutions, strong activist group in Blr \

Weather: dry climate overall - Real Challenge in WM is wet waste (flies) - Advantageous in dry climate compared to Kerala - No extreme weather (North India cold makes microbial activity difficult) \","Huge populated city: rate of growth > infrastructure - IT: disposable income higher - Affluence creates more waste \

Civic bodies not specialists, do not have knowledge. Do not seek expert help \ 

No real management of waste in India - Only dumping of mixed waste - Composting units use mixed waste leading to heavy metal contamination of soil - Intervene at domestic level - Huge achievement and opportunity to segregate and convert \

Recycling to reduce petrol based resource requirements - Dumping grounds: Breeding ground for rats, flies - Dogs - Huge environment issue \

Inst waste is regulated by license: no enforcement at domestic level, need awareness \","Minimum interaction with civic bodies - Purely private initiative - Work directly with beneficiaries \

Different levels to waste - 1. House, 2. Institutional, 3. Local env (roadside trees) - Domestic waste, traditional understanding is centralised - We are trying to break that \

Wet waste at home, sensitive area - Solution: Solid state, aerobic based on bioclay (patented) - Can help manage wet waste without flies, smell, leaking - Generate good quality organic manure, especially for those who grow their own food - ""Clean houses, safe food"" \

Solution can be adopted at domestic & community level - Mixing of waste causes complexities and mostly happens at home - Segregation is important \

Initially only looked at coir pith - Crisis led to creation of microbiology lab - Used to create a new line of products of bio fertilizers, bio pesticides \

Didn’t come into business for the sake of business - wanted to solve my problem of waste land - 100 acre project: bought in 1991 - More observation than experiment - Travelled a lot to understand success and failures - People in India have know how but not know why \ 

Developed technology by 1998-99 - PhD in coir pith (1994): Convert into soil conditioner, Tech for correction in coir - Lab and field (“I come from the field”) \

Business: NABARD started following and suggested commercial project on waste - Got opportunity to export to Australia (Via Agri University ) - Aus were getting coir pith from Sri Lanka - No commercial value then in India - 1st firm to export coir pith from India (1997) \

6 months on product , 6 months on m/c - Team: friend/partner who is microbiologist (co PhD) - Commercial establishment (pvt ltd) supported by family and related family (7-8 directors) - Expanded using loan from SBI \

Local suppliers “stole” the idea (dry and compress) but not cleaning - Created bad name for Indian coco pith market - Financial crisis - fortunately, got a grant from ministry of Agri, sci and tech, family \

Also involved in agro waste management, slaughter waste management (chicken slaughter waste: Karnataka, Kerala, TN: 20L Tonnes/year, 25% waste, most thrown into sea/river, dug into soil - slaughter waste is mostly protein: i.e nitro - Our coco peat is mostly carbon: balances nitro and soil does well \

Not as aware of fish waste: recently handled waste of 1 fish (15-20000 tonnes/year thrown back into sea) \

Fuel briquette: Coir pith + tamarind shells + sawdust - Densified to give calorific value - Has potential - When burning, only using 30-40% energy - Do we need to generate heat from this technique? - better than fossil fuel(nonrenewable) - Environmental tech provided we have enough for soil - But biomass can be regenerated only if soil is healthy \

From soil health perspective - Bring max biomass back into soil - Light is primary source of energy, converted into chemical energy by photosynthesis - Natural process: food to animals, debris into soil - “Energy flow into ecosystem” \

Quite involved in fuel business too - Bio flame by a friend (Kerala) - Efficient oven using fuel briquette - Cost of running is 50% of commercial gas - Started business for catering (hotels, commercial) - Realised they are generating food waste and got in touch with OE \

Tech consultant to large papaya product papeine enzyme - Needs 5000 acres of continuous papaya production - Papaya very challenging for cultivation and harvesting - 5 Tonnes of organic manure/acre \

All of these guys getting into waste management eg. Neeta Gelatin - 100T of bone daily, 50T of sludge daily, very smelly - 10 years ago designed system to convert into manure without smells - Now working with an entrepreneur: Potential: 70000 tonnes of manure/year \

Every waste management company in Blr trying to use OE tech \

Promoted first farmers company in India - Indian organic farmers producers co in Cochin owned by 5000 farmers - 2002, new in companies act producers co as opposed to co-ops - More flexible - No influence of co-op board - Export lots of products \

Marketing: India’s first certification co for organic - Founding director of Ecova, Blr \",,,,,"Whole concept of sustainability = very large subject - Resources managed for sustained strength - 20 years later some productivity - Most important resource = sunlight - Second = soil, health is critical aspect \

Organic matter in soil => carbohydrates - Huge life in soil in tropical India: 30-40L earthworms/acre, 10-15 tonnes of microbes/acre -  - Nutrient cycle - Porosity - makes soil healthier \

Green revolution: chemicals -> change in concept of feeding(cow dung): from soil to plant (NPK) directly - Over the last 30-40 years, all land - 2015 = year of soil (UN) - Soil health is single biggest issue in agriculture - No organic matter in soil \

All soils in India are depleted (0.5% organic matter instead of 2%) - Soil controls all other resources - Organic matter carries water, 1 acre of forest = 40-50 lakh litres of water, released slowly into stream after rains \ 

Organic matter provides food to all life in soil - Also gives buffering capacity (maintains pH) \

Soil temperature is a serious issue, higher when less organic matter(thermally insulating) - Heat from soil penetrates us more than lower wavelength from sunlight \

Biodiversity better when soil is healthy - Weak soil health => Weak plant health => more chemicals to protect against pest and disease agriculture more expensive and prone to climate change => Water contamination => human health \

Depletion of organic matter: What we are doing is not waste management - Waste is another big challenge and could be a solution to this problem - Imagine the opportunity: wet waste could solve this soil issue \

Greenopia: Most important to growing media: air/water balance at roots - Commercial agri doesn’t address this - In our plantations: we start by addressing this - we have lots of products - Coco bio-peat has all nutrients required at root zone - “Certified organic” \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Because one without knowing what it is “Taking up a challenge and generating a solution with commercial potential, lot of risk and you must be willing to address the risk” \

Continuous chain of activity evolved into business - I don’t run away from a challenge, go forward and meet it, then seen solutions evolving with commercial sense \

Started with 9 directors - everyone left, they lost confidence - now only me and my wife \","Still a startup after 18-20 yrs: very early bird in this business solving one problem after another, creating new enterprises(to solve problems) \","Guest lectures at colleges for biotech, agri students - often a motivational speaker - 18 years later continuing to seek new solutions - Faced down financial challenges \",Definitely - a value chain program - Weak linkages between enterprises who address different links as per their strengths \,,,,"Unless you address any issue from value chain you won’t be commercially successful - whole chain: if any link is weak the chain is weak - You have to address all links - Lots of integration required - The chain has to be strong enough to sustain the operations \
","Enterprise is integration of tech, fin, human, logistics, product quality and design - Any successful enterprise integration or synthesis - Unless you identify the components you need to integrate you will have challenges \

You should have the right protocol - e.g. financial: agrarian clients, repayment is late (buy at seeding, pay at reaping) - Every component has a different need - Fin from one enterprise cannot be applied to another - Mentors should at least be able to guide \",,"You don’t do anything in isolation,It is all connected \

Govt has a role but doesn’t understand anything - Real contribution of Abdul Kalam: 30 yrs ago, nuclear program with no external support - Looked at whole chain, identified links, strengthened weak links, connected them - cost effective, leading nation now \

Currently helping waste management project in Kerala, trial phase - 3000 houses in 1 month - After Onam, targeting entire city corporation - Operating in lower income groups - Capital cost met by CSR - Families paying Rs. 200 with monthly income 10k-20k - In Kerala , every family must manage their waste \

","BBMP’s refusal to support segregation: make contractors take and transport segregated - payment by tonnage: system designed to be anti waste minimization - 1996: 80% wet waste, 5% dry waste, now they claim its more “I doubt it” \

Traffic, but not part of the city \

Biggest problem: Corruption, no political will - no scarcity of technical solutions - All tenders are fixed: whoever offers highest kickback \

Plastic “bag” killed off dust bin collections - when plastic bags entered wet waste, farmers stopped taking the waste back - “Catch them young”- children, villages, towns - Apartments giving waste to piggery: how much can pigs eat? \

Ramki claimed they had a leachate pond  was irrigating farms around: soil and crops are dead, uncultivated - Buffer zones: trees will die too - Mawallipura village: flies bringing cholera, carried by buffalos (3km from plant) - Leo Saldanha mobilised the villagers to close down the plant \

State allotted site to BBMP which invited Ramki (via tender) - Ramki compost plant in Mavallipura (3km from everywhere) - 300 ton compost plant, 30 yr lease Rs. 1/acre/year \

BBMP sent 600-700 tonnes/day to a site built for 300 tonnes - Rs. 166-700 tonne (10% increase per year) paid for all of waste instead of just compost - Transport and land paid for by taxpayer - Same situation in Gurgaon - Setting up WM plants has become a scam and racket \

No monitoring - farmers compare cost of compost to manure (Rs 1800/tonne) - Production cost of compost is high because of lack of segregation otherwise would fit budgets of farmers - Compost people: pay us tipping fee to accept waste (compensation) \

US tipping fee: entrepreneurs can buy land and rent out for landfill - NJ used to pay $100/tonne(18years ago) to landfill operation in Penn state - Toronto -> Michigan $400/tonne - Rent for capital invested \

Ground water pollution for 3km around - Mavallipura closed due to villager protests - 700 tonnes split (350 Terraforma+ 350 Mandoor) - Blr 2nd after Trivandrum to face such issue \

Health Impact: Water is incredibly polluted: Turkish coffee like water from village pump - Irreversible: no way to get it out (stopping the pollution or pumping out) \","Don’t attend meetings of SWMRT, don’t do anything, have to go from macro to micro and back again \

Not a Bangalorean - manage my own wastewater - difficult to use solar due to trees, under panchayat until 2007 (studied neglect after BBMP acquisition) \

Wish I was not doing this, like to do something about nature, got into this to protect rural roads from waste - green belts vs green ribbons: protect nalas, lakes - look up CDP map: 4-5 km belt around Blr \

Work on national canvas, look up website - BBMP: dumping on highway because the space had run out - No one’s land: National Highway won’t defend shoulders - Chased the files down and found land - builders lobby don’t want dumped waste \

Fighting for buffer zones - supreme court, now with National Tribunal(1975) \

Oldest waste management plant in India is in Blr - buffer zone was cut from 500m to 50m to help builders lobby - Now residents against WM plant - US law understanding near landfills - States must give cities space for waste management \

Municipal solid waste management rules 1999: used by CPCB and Union Env Ministry - Rules were 95% ok (take what I can get) - 5% was incineration which has now grown to a genie \

As Engineer and parsi, think everyone is good and honest - Never thought I would give birth to this \ 

Water hyacinth choking all water bodies in India - Orphaned waste - Someone using to make fibre for sanitary napkins - Lake Eerie 1971: lower phosphorus levels (detergent) to limit water weed growth \

Low mercury tube lights - Lead free paints - Copy of IA 22 (wish list of what I want courts to do) \

Scarcity of animal manure leading to low nitrogen levels - “Limiting nutrient “ (Nitrogen => hybrid seeds, urea factories) - “Green revolution” - Indian soils have low levels of carbon (now limiting nutrient) now due to low organic manure \

In 1960s: bullock cart of waste went door to door in Blr - farmers would bring produce into city and fight over dustbins on lanes to take back - British built liquid mgmt systems: no SWM because there was no waste \

From 1960s: urea was easy, organic manure was laborious - Organic waste from fields was and is being burnt instead of being composed \

Towns were small, farm land was 2-3km away - Metros like Bombay, where will you find a field to accept your waste/manure - As Blr grows into absolutely large metro, for political reasons villages were consumed into city without services - “City has come to me with multi storeys” \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Opportunity for entrepreneurs as empanelled vendors: absolutely the way to go - An entrepreneur should have a transport vehicle and use it part of the time for the collection - Bulk generators still need empanelled vendors for dry waste and rejects (10%) \

Scope for Sanipad management - Rule: all cities must have a service provider for hospital biomedical waste mgmt (incinerator, shredder) - Blr is pioneering separate bag for sanitary  napkins and dropped off at pick up points for biomedical waste \

Rs. 25/month/apartment for collection of sani waste - Cost of disposal same as cost of sanitary products - Bio-waste incinerators only 40% utilised - 2 providers: Ramki(North), Meridi (South) - Other private incinerators with KPCB clearance - Scope for entrepreneurs: fleet of part time vehicles to manage this waste \

An apartment complex has tied up with a farmer and bring produce and take compost away - “Brilliant model” \ 

Another way is to promote terrace gardening - Also has a cooling effect - Scope for entrepreneurs: service to encourage rooftop gardens within bulk generators -  currently pay contractors extra illicitly to take waste away \ 

Tenant farming (allotments in germany where you can relax and garden) - Would be stolen in India \

APMC market in Yeshwantpur or city market - If compost can be organised and taken to these markets - Wouldn’t work with distributed collections \

Huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to be a service provider (“take care of maggots”) - Doesn’t need to be empanelled but helps in being found - AMC model? - empanelled to be allowed to take waste away - FCO compost regulations: can sell as soil evidence (humus content is of value) NPK is purely incidental \

Young man doing construction demolition, Stone crusher - ILFS has similar plant in Delhi - Hassles with permission - BBMP is totally bloody minded - entrepreneurs should look at nearby cities/towns who won’t give grief - Same grief as Blr in metros \

Nobody is taking notice in small towns (4900+ towns) - Cost is lower - Easier to get space, permissions - Set up in Panchayat area and service in Blr - Still a question of “What’s in it for me”? - 65% of contract value is bribe \

Model town is “Kolar” - Beautiful waste management system - 1 month: doorstep collection, 70% voluntary segregation, rest at plant - 1 of 210 towns do without landfill \

DMA (Directorate of Municipal Administration) - Responsible for small towns - Ask “Which small town” - Any temple town has mountains of coconuts, marigold - Temple in Blr: lemon shells used as lamps - Now using lemon juice for squash (previously gutter), lemon shells dried and powdered \

Town in Kerala with lots of elephants - What do we do with elephant dung? \

Prof. Anil Gupta (Honeybee network, IIMA) - Be the “lab to land” link - Huge number of projects lying on shelves - Student designed a land mine detector - 1 Landmine/capita in Cambodia \

Wanted to be an angel investor - Went to Anil Gupta who has many small inventions - All of these projects need small investments to buy components - They don't have marketing or money to make 2 of the things and sell - offered to back 3 projects - Anil Gupta never got back: Instead asked for donation\

Likes seeking out multiple, gets bored - Large overlaps with Acara so helps being social and networking - Feast or famine at Acara - Often work in self generated/self learning - Coursera (MOOCs) - May(3 weeks )+ 2 months leading up to fall is busy - Lets other orgs know when she’s busy in may \

Soon to be full time in Acara, other promising at UMinn (USAID, other progs) (Nascent) - Travel+ inducting new partners - Asked to hire interns so she can concentrate on big picture \

2 years at IIHS partnering Acara  - 1 year at Acara \",,,,,"4 weeks to 10 months with orgs - Fellowship following fall semester - 25 fall semester students led to 3 fellows - 1. Civil Engineering: beekeeping for marginal farmers - 2. Masters in Public Health working with Swasthi (reproductive wealth) - 3. Civil Engineering (renewable energy),  Selco for med devices \

Ana: communications, writing, fairly analytical, low quantitative skills - Erin: bee keeper, adaptability - fellowship not as expected but still learnt worldly wisdom \

System: Ask questions - Raw emotions \

Fellowship: min 1 week, determined by organisations (eg. Swasth, track workflow/patient flow, student spent 3 days in clinic, course asked for 1 week community service learning) - Needs of other courses - Interdisciplinary? - Looking beyond India too \
Selco asks for 6 months - Robic to spend 3 months: solar microscope \

Sharing:
Data/impact surveys: Aruna will check if shareable (not project wide, specific after fall sem etc, might not have impact survey) \

Main objectives of Acara:  Support impact, innovation, sustainability - “How are you an enabler in students’ innovation thinking? - Look to us as supporters/enablers in future endeavours \

How does Acara influence (control) future growth of student? - creating a comprehensive ecosystem - eg. entrepreneurship in Rwanda: Partnership with incubators (soft landing) - why, what: if convinced that student will implement/follow through \

Funding for graduates: eg. student came to TISS for 3 weeks after grad, wants to come back - through CSR? - Create corpus? - Low interest loans? - NFP/Social enterprise can’t offer - Learning scenarios from students \

Institute of the environment was formed to make “learning in the sciences accessible to outside community” \

University is very bureaucratic, Acara fairly renegade - Institute of Environment new director is she (Mid 40s) - current director is middle aged (50s, male, white) \

Social enterprises like Selco are part of inner sanctum - Have program partners and fellowship partners - Selco is both - Starting point: program partners (day long visit etc), feeds into fellowship \",,,,,,,,"Student age range: 18-35 (mostly 18-25) \

Interaction with students: Seasonal - Sep - Dec: student teams (3-5) work on business ideas - Talk to one team/Week -Introduce to entrepreneurs/orgs - Help students when stuck/ with group dynamics \

Peer to peer insight: fraud - Privileged backgrounds - Should I even do this? - Am I the right person? (course requirement) - Empathising with students \

Mapping background to Acara, screening: What brought them - community service - why will they add value \",,,Very few parents meddle but do worry - Concerned about introversion - Health (vaccination) \,,"Students do a good job of putting folks at ease - Aruna has offered to talk with parents - Open house with parents helps \

On quitting and starting up - Aruna will question “have you given yourself enough time” - Will question younger ones \

Gestures from Director - dinners at home \

Communication issues due to internet while travelling \",,,,,"Only person from large institute - Worked from home, couldn’t work - Lives in north, partners in centre/south - Space is legitimacy (meetings) - Initially thought Jaaga was too expensive (July 2014) - hadn’t researched coworking - Met MC at Idex event \

Met interesting people - Expanding understanding of innovation - Fall sem: work from comp at home, (9pm classes) \


Pet flare-up: unsafe for pedestrians (lighting, drains) - Walk down Richmond road is unpleasant \

Jaaga doesn’t actively give access to creativity - Lots of platforms in the city/Information dissemination /Info overload - Wants support in campaigning, cannot run everything - Activism: Hasn’t met activists at Jaaga \

No groceries/Restaurants on Richmond road - Forced to used bigbasket - Wants to try food delivery to so she can recommend to students \",,,,"Aruna interviewing entrepreneurs - “Water/sanitation”: is jumping off -  Students explore, pick specific tech and start -  Too much info at policy level - Now talking to entrepreneurs first up \

Counterpart in Minneapolis, does same as Aruna - Context in Minneapolis comes from him \

Aruna helping build context in other countries - Not yet the right person - Identify the right partners in Bangladesh (trust their judgement) \

Focus areas: energy, rural electrification - not education, transport. mobility (time limitations) - Keeping up with current issues - Water management: Students given choice of hypotheses/orgs \",,,,,,,,"At the end of semester: Indicate assumptions - What they have done - What they would like to do with more time? (Leading to fellowship) - What did they not do - Fellowships not always to expectations of students - How important are the goals? Maps to maturity of organisations \

Example: 5 options offered to student -> 3 selected -> interaction through skype etc ->  placement - No process beyond \

Interns write for Acara’s blog (also Institute of Environment) - 2 blogs required, discussions stem from blogs \",,,,,,"Local sensibility and entrepreneurship: As an educator, can identify entrepreneurship beyond formal channels - Informal (marketplaces) quite important - “great learning” \",,,"In an everyday sense, Mumbai is more entrepreneurial - Bangalore more structured/elite -  Rickshaw Drivers - Entrepreneurs: very focussed, discourse is skewed towards system - Mumbai more about people \

Indian students risk averse (questions, failures, high expectations) - American more open - People should fail more often - Success has many friends, bike rental co failed in silence -  tokenism, opportunism \

Centurion University in Orissa - Wants risk talking students - Hands on program(masters) - Students don’t think of it as legitimate \",,"Local: IIHS based in India - used to do similar program - On their way to becoming university -  Students interested in entrepreneurship - IIHS got funding from Rockefeller Foundation \

Incubation: NSRCEL: tech and business - funding from DBT - mentors: professors, alumni - “Enable people to follow their ideas” - Space + Mentoring + Funding \

IIHS scaled down incubation for students - Largely in the realm of experimentation - e.g. team of 4-5 from NMIMS (all local) - Eco friendly transportation - Bike rental - Good people, money - Academic/ parental pressures - Team, negotiation, built characters, insight \

One team from Chhattisgarh: poor English, IIHS helped in presentation - equal to IIT/IIM -  IIHS couldn’t penetrate education system \","Fyne by a friend: highly custom, local restaurants, Fyne will consolidate orders from multiple restaurants, focus on non-dominant areas (north, west) \

","Innovation: how does a vegetable vendor assess how much to buy from KR market? \

Acara: Dedicated 10 month fellowship - No opinion on students quitting and starting up - Selection: Very closely divided to idea - No student has quit and started up except My Rain in Madurai, Steel quit his job in Minnesota, moved here and started up \"

We started working in India 1 year ago - Climate group funding (Pilot) \


SunSaluter office in Sunkadakatte, Karnataka - 3 people based there \","Dependencies - Skype and viber once a week \

Dependencies - Not totally autonomous - We are not for profit - Reports to write to funding partners - Requirements to hit \

Adjustment in working in Indian system - Americans are more deadline oriented \",,,,,"End-user is slightly different than our customers - Our customer are the people doing work in solar off grid - End users access SunSaluter through customer \

End- user - Rural India - living off grid - Typically relies on kerosene and wood - Insufficient light - Children cannot study - Smoke inhalation - Less productivity of parents \",Varies - 2000 to 10000 rupees monthly household income per month \,We don’t do a whole lot - Organisations/Partners they do most of work \,"End users sometimes help design initiative - Some customers \

SunSaluter design is patented but we are open \

A goal would be to work with the government \","Criteria - 3 primary partners based on a lot of trust \

Now we want to work with more people - Trust is a challenge - Conceptualising pipeline for partners - Step of gradual increase in trusting and working together \",,"M&E - Administer baseline and follow ups - Partners are capable of collecting data - SS analysis - Country director conducts follow-up surveys 

Sometimes country director limitation on the field is lack of ability to speak all languages besides Hindi \

Data tracking is a weakness of ours \

SunSaluter survey content - Examples: Local cost of kerosene - Difficulties in electricity - Health impacts - Current system difficulties \","Impact goals - Be financially sustainable by end of 2016 \

Global grassroots mission to get SunSaluter out there - Business - Make resources available such as the tool kit plan \",,Entrepreneur - An innovative individual who sees opportunity that others do not see \,Startup - Organisation around that vision and willing to try new things to make happen with limited resources \,,There is a role for entrepreneurs - All individual leading orgs we work with are entrepreneurs in solar off grid space \,"Ent advantages - Superlative local knowledge, understand how things work - Which might be why we do not see large, global solar companies - Small = Agile \",Ent barrier - Primary is access to capital - Takes money to start and get to sustainability \,"Ent challenges - Ignored by formal economy, entrepreneur with local mindset to tackle them \

Ent challenges - Small scale no access to wider base of knowledge and resources - Really have to bootstrap \

In 2011 - Participated in water hackathon - IWP and IIHS organised - We made our water hackathon project open source and left at that - Then we said we will take this on (Startup) \

We weren’t the experts - No background in Chemistry, Hardware, etc \
(In ref to water hackathon project) Friends said why don’t you guys take this project on yourself \
Water and Sanitation org gave grant to pursue project \

Open source is an inspiration \

Open data - Map and push - Through kit \

Previously did software for water organisations \","Certainly - Before knew nothing about water quality in Bangalore \

More you study, more you become aware \

Water to Food (Relationship) - Useful way of looking at society \

Story: Village - Field test - People walking 4km to only source of water - Water is greenish and people have to drink - Water you wouldn’t even touch \

(In relation to story) Forces you to look at your own life \","Technology - Techies - Lots of people willing - I spent time in Tier 2 city Dharwar (Not the same as Bangalore) \

Bangalore’s infrastructure, people, impact investors, tech meet ups happening every weekend - Lot of orgs and people can give access \","In Bangalore, we don’t see real urban poverty \

Agriculture belt around Bangalore \

Bangalore stressed in water and air quality - ‘Entrepreneur class’ is not exposed to that \

‘Entrepreneur class’ does not have to be in or exposed to these issues \
Most people doing food delivery when they could be focused on something else \","Caddisfly - TernUp product - low cost water quality testing kit \

Bangalore water is blessed - No fluoride or arsenic in water - Traces are in Karnataka 150km outside of Bangalore \

Making rapid bacteria test for Bangalore - Goal - Test should take a hour - Currently takes 24 to 48 hours to test \

Rapid bacteria test for fecal matter and contamination of water \","External dependencies - Yes - Nature of business dealing with customers and partners \

Arghyam got everyone working on fluoride and arsenic together - Arsenic and Fluoride Network - Expected to be independently run by collaborators \

Open source nature - Everyone would be paid the same \

Found hard to raise investment because of intellectual property (IP) \

Akvo foundation started funding TernUp - To speed up development - Also open source - AKVO makes software tools - Akvo started similarly with everyone getting paid the same \","Water challenge everywhere in Bangalore - Tanker water reliance - More vulnerable area - Slum, low income areas  stressed for water \","A lot of time on the field - talk about water - Immersed - Taking tests - Talking to partners - We (TernUp) know we lack knowledge - Product dev ideas stem from this \

Peri-urban areas of Bangalore are stressed - People from these areas come to serve Bangalore \

Water belt of Cauvery to Bangalore area - Road networks \",,"Air - Quality - Topic becoming increibly popular - Samuel interest is very high - As middle and upper class can buy themselves out of anything: Roads and air have to share with everyone \

Most people crib about roads and air - No matter how much money you have - Can’t buy your way out of this \

In touch with person making air sensors (Based in Chennai) \

Food - Gov’t example in general (KA) - Has standards for fluoride - Fluoride exists in ground water - Ground to surface - Ground water goes back to surface water \

Ground water used for agriculture and irrigation - Fluoride is going into food, milk, cattle, etc \

We don’t have overall standard for fluoride \

People in West Bengal and Bihar don’t know there is arsenic in rice \","Caddisfly - End user - Right now people most affected by fluoride and arsenic water cannot do anything about it \

Caddisfly - End user - Not for profits, health organisations - People already working in this space are customers \

Caddisfly - End user - Large multi-lateral agencies - Working in district - District reach \

Caddisfly - End user - People supplying water - Especially guys working with cheap water \","Avg household income for Caddisfly target audience is Rs 50,000 per year \","1 to 2 times per month interaction with end users all over India - In Karnataka at the moment: Tumkur, Kadhar \","End users certainly help design our initiative - Example: S3 IDEA: Educated TernUp = Small scale sustainable infrastructure development fund - Set up microentrepreneurs for those working in fluoride - Setting up business model to be commercially viable \

(Cont’d) S3 IDEA - Educated TernUp - Example: Told us to share results of the field tests to communities - After conducting field tests \","QC - We are not quite there yet to talk about quality control \

We have 200 kits and have sold 20 to 30 kits - For quality control example would be rejects \

QC - In earlier stage of starting up, not much money - Struggled in prototyping - Small vendors had poor practice and quality of pieces were tough - We sourced locally in Peenya",End user access - Cannot afford Caddisfly kit - ,"QC - Now - With more funding - Better quality prototyping - Vendor: Imaginarium (In Bombay) - We have temptations to go to China - No one equivalent to Imaginarium in Bangalore \

Caddisfly scale - Coming to a point where we have to look past Imaginarium \

Caddisfly - We have to set up processes - We need quality control, supply chain, manufacturing process \",Solution on end user access - Need intermediary to set up filter - Middle person to pass on information \,"Resources and tools - Dremel tool to enable prototypes \

Shristi College of Art, Design and Technology - Samuel taught at Srishti while Saurav was studying at Shristi - Worked on open source mapping test project \

Free advice is a resource \

Fluoride and Arsenic network and knowledge \",6 people working on Caddisfly product right now - 7 people part of TernUp - Average age is 32 to 33 years old \,"Funded by Akvo - No profit, no loss - Bulk of money goes into salaries - The rest goes into manufacturing, travel, etc \

Hard to get funding because hard to explain water and fluoride challenge to investors - Example: Mentality - Just don’t drink the water \","Yes - Technology based product - We used also used technology for mapping \

We are strongest on tech side, less strong in chemistry, older science side \","Was affected by location and work space - At one point we didn’t have a space - Worked from home (Flex) - We worked out of Centre for Internet and Society - Current spot is a friend’s and left furniture \

We will grow - Lab and office space in future \","Team skills - Prototyping - Industrial design - Software - Domain areas: Chemistry and Bio - Hustling is a skill \

When starting TernUp we had vague general skills - Now we have very specific skills/person - A criteria for hiring \",We should have skill development training - Have not started yet - Teams skills are growing - On-the-job training - Increase capacity in electronics \,"Internally, yes we practice active collaboration \

Externally, we actively collaborate with Akvo - Maybe more will come when our product goes out to market \","Certainly collaboration leads to learning - Whys - Why isn’t this working? - Questions - Presentations within team on chemistry \

As long as team is small no problem in collaboration - We are good friends - One time made mistake on hiring \",,"We are part of the Fluoride and Arsenic Network - Arghyam gives money - In Margunda gov’t organised meeting (Trying to get more gov’t involvement - TernUp has hosted in Bangalore \

Government involvement in Karnataka isn’t as big a problem as in other states \","Water sector these is culture of open sharing - tech\software there is culture of open sharing \

Testing and treatment - culture of open sharing is locked away in patents (TCS project example of keeping information) \

Data measured in house \",Our hardware and software data is up on Github - Nobody has made a pull request - We hope to change - Fluoride and Arsenic Network saw TernUp was on Github then they started their own repository to put up solutions form group \,"Akvo is partnership - Through Akvo we met SNV Foundation (Mass not for profit) - They have given funding for improving testing \

We partner with ICCO in Kenya (SME) \
Criteria",,100% private partnerships at the moment - ICCO (SME in Kenya) as some money coming from gov’t \,"Data we have is number of kits sold and number of complaints \

We don’t document our processes very well \

We are out of research phase now - Moving into manufacturing phase \",TernUp upcoming goals are: Industrial design and manufacturing - Testing for Arsenic and polyforms - Sell a lot of fluoride kits all over the country \,All of TernUp and Caddisfly info on Github and blog \,"Saurav - Entrepreneur is person who looks for the problem \

Ishan - Entrepreneur is person who wants to start own thing instead of being part of existing org \

Samuel - Entrepreneur is somebody who fixes problem with economic angle \","Saurav - Startup is the line between small business and startup \

Ishan - What isn’t a startup? Perception on a company being a startup can be excused for not having things in place \

Samuel - Startup is addressing problem in some novel way not project before \","Saurav - Friends are entrepreneurs - Keep meeting entrepreneurs \

Ishan - Interact with entrepreneurs a lot \

Samuel - Yes, interact with entrepreneurs in water space - Advice sharing - (Example: Dharwar) - Weekly \","Sam: Of course there is a role for entrepreneurs - Everything in India is a problem - India economy booming (Example: CSR law) - More options to get money \

Sam: Great time to be a social entrepreneur in India \",Sam: No shortage of people with ideas is an advantage - Bangalore and Delhi are hubs for talent \,"Sam: People with ideas don’t have skills - Big gap - People with entrepreneurial drive don’t have skills \

Sam: Raising money is a barrier \

Sam: Lot of guys fresh out of college who want to start something - Without knowing what to solve \

Sam: Go after a tough problem \

Ish: New entrepreneur should know what a good idea is - Lack of good ideas \

Sau: All these ‘food delivery and fitness apps’ \ 

Sau: Barrier is government is unreceptive - We don’t know our government schemes \","Sam: Hardware is a challenge \

Sam: If starting, start in Bangalore \

Sam: No access to tech and manufacturing is a challenge \

Sam: Sense of isolation of rural from mainstream is a challenge - Example: Dharwar if you use the acronyms API or UI they do not have a clue - Those is rural have good ideas and intentions - They don’t know the possibilities \","Sam: New markets are tough \

Sam: To succeed is to be plain lucky \

Sam: Swinging right deal at the right time \

Sam: Entrepreneurship is a tough battle \

Sam: Bad hire - If we kept him would have been bad \","Sau: Some kind of community would be a good resource \

Sau: Better impact investors would be a good resource \

Sam: Forums are a good resource \

Sam: Good prototyping and manufacturing resources are needed - Example: Low cost version of Imaginarium \",,"We’re past startup phase - By Dec 2015 - Merging with AKVO company \

Technology aspect is weak of organisations like ATREE, India Water Portal, Arghyam \

India uses activated alumina process right now to test water \

3D printing is quick, cost effective solution \

TernUp - Why Kenya? Data of fluoride in India is very poor (No data on Bangalore) - Situation much worse in Kenya - Public there does not know why \

Only 1 not for profit making filters in Kenya despite the massive problem in Kenya - Current solution is using bone char (Bone char not used in India because of religious reasons \
